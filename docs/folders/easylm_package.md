## Common Usage Patterns

1. Training New Models
```python
from EasyLM.models.llama import LLaMAModel
from EasyLM.data import DataProcessor
from EasyLM.optimizers import create_optimizer

# Model initialization
model = LLaMAModel(config)
optimizer = create_optimizer(model)
data_processor = DataProcessor(config)

# Training loop
for batch in data_processor:
    loss = model.train_step(batch, optimizer)
```

2. Serving Models
```python
from EasyLM.serving import ModelServer
from EasyLM.models.llama import LLaMAModel

# Server initialization
model = LLaMAModel.load_checkpoint(path)
server = ModelServer(model)
server.start()
```

3. Checkpoint Management
```python
from EasyLM.checkpoint import CheckpointManager

# Checkpoint handling
ckpt_manager = CheckpointManager(directory)
ckpt_manager.save(model_state)
model_state = ckpt_manager.load()
